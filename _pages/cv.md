Projects
======

* **Recommendation System - Information Retrieval**
  * Feb 2022 - June 2022
    * Built a deep learning-based recommendation system to predict the rating that a given user gives to an item
    * Applied the Graph Neural Network(GNN) to model the user-user and user-item interactions along with the attention 
    * framework to differentiate ratings from the interactions
