I am an incoming graduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I will pursue my Master's in Computer Science. I'm interested in **natural language processing, recommender systems**, and **computational social sciences.**

Prior to joining UCSD, I was a Visiting Associate in the World Well Being Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked closely with [Prof Sharath Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/) and [Prof Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/home.html). My research focuses on building predictive ML models for uncovering insight into health outcomes and psychological states of individuals and communities using large scale unstructured textual data. This research aims to supplement clinical diagnoses and facilitate early and personalized interventions for improving treatments and well-being.My recent work with Dr. Guntuku and [Dr. Alison Buttenheim](https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/details/profiles.php?id=37) focussed on building computational algorithms that enable social listening of concerns that impede vaccine confidence in the Indian context.I was also affiliated with the World Bank Group and collaborated with [Sharada Srinivasan](https://www.sharsrinivasan.com/) to uncover valuable insights using Big Data techniques across various sectors in Myanmar post Coup and COVID.

At Amazon Machine Learning, I was a part of the Last Mile Planning team, where I used deep learning techniques for transit time optimization. I learned how crucial it is to find the sweet spot between accuracy and latency and ensure that the model inputs are readily available in production. My experience in the E-Trading team at JP Morgan exposed me to the scale and working of the ML models in production. My experiences have helped me realize the profound impact technology can have on our lives.
