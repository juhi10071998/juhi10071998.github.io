I am an incoming graduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I will pursue my Master's in Computer Science. I'm interested in **natural language processing, recommender systems**, and **computational social sciences.**

Prior to joining UCSD, I was a Visiting Associate in the World Well Being Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, where I worked closely with [Prof Sharath Guntuku](https://sharathg.cis.upenn.edu/) and [Prof Lyle Ungar](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ungar/home.html). My research focuses on building predictive ML models for uncovering insight into health outcomes and psychological states of individuals and communities using large scale unstructured textual data. This research aims to supplement clinical diagnoses and facilitate early and personalized interventions for improving treatments and well-being.My recent work with Dr. Guntuku and [Dr. Alison Buttenheim](https://www.nursing.upenn.edu/details/profiles.php?id=37) focussed on building computational algorithms that enable social listening of concerns that impede vaccine confidence in the Indian context.I was also affiliated with the World Bank Group and collaborated with [Sharada Srinivasan](https://www.sharsrinivasan.com/) to uncover valuable insights using Big Data techniques across various sectors in Myanmar post Coup and COVID.

At Amazon Machine Learning, I was a part of the Last Mile Planning team, where I used deep learning techniques for transit time optimization. I learned how crucial it is to find the sweet spot between accuracy and latency and ensure that the model inputs are readily available in production. My experience in the E-Trading team at JP Morgan exposed me to the scale and working of the ML models in production. My experiences have helped me realize the profound impact technology can have on our lives.


Research Interest
I would love to develop systems that belong in:

* The problem of recommendation amuses me particularly. I am curious to learn more about how companies like Amazon and Airbnb store data of millions of customers efficiently and provide instant recommendations. I have been exploring the application of Graph Neural networks to understand the various challenges in the domain.

* Developing scalable computational language models utilizing large-scale user generated text on social media platforms:
I believe that social media platforms such as Reddit and Twitter, rich ecological sources of human interactions, can offer large volumes of unbiased conversations that can be summarized using NLP. They can help form targeted messaging and mitigation strategies, especially during crises and public health emergencies.
    
* Expanding on the above, the rife of hate speech and toxicity is of particular concern today. The language models like BERT and GPT2 have been found to frequently favor identity terms, such as "gay" and "black," that describe a particular group of people. I am currently exploring techniques to mitigate such biases and build fair language models. Additionally, During crisis like COVID 19, the spread of fake news and misinformation have exacerbated the attempts by governments to distribute vaccines to fight the virus.
